# AutoFire Master Spec & Vision

## Project Vision
AutoFire is a next-generation fire alarm system design platform. It empowers non-programmers and professionals alike to visually design, document, and manage fire alarm systems from concept to submittal, installation, and commissioning. The vision is to make code-compliant, efficient, and collaborative fire alarm design accessible, visual, and error-proof.

## What We Are Doing
- Building a visual, step-by-step system builder for fire alarm design.
- Supporting canonical manufacturer/brand normalization for device selection.
- Treating annunciators as a distinct device type in the UI and workflow.
- Enabling floorplan import, drag-and-drop device placement, and code compliance checks.
- Providing interactive wiring, circuit, and power calculations.
- Generating submittal-ready documentation, BOMs, and compliance reports.
- Laying the foundation for advanced features: AI-driven design, collaboration, mobile field tools, and more.

## What We Need (Feature Reference)
- Intuitive, modern UI with clear workflow steps and visual feedback.
- Device catalog with canonical brands, images, datasheets, and code metadata.
- Device planning cards for each type (smoke, heat, notification, pull, annunciator, special hazard).
- Floorplan canvas with device palette, snap-to-grid, and code overlays.
- Annunciators shown as a separate section, with placement guidance and compliance logic.
- Interactive wiring diagram overlay, voltage drop and battery calculations.
- Exportable submittal package: plans, BOM, calculations, datasheets, sequence of operations.
- Collaboration: version history, comments, task assignment, cloud sync.
- Field/commissioning tools: mobile mode, QR code device tags, live test checklists.
- AI/Expert system: code Q&A, design suggestions, predictive analytics.

## How We Work (DevOps/Process)
- All changes tracked in GitHub with clear branches and PRs.
- Roadmap and vision documents are versioned in `docs/`.
- Non-programmers can request features, review progress, and provide feedback via visual tools and documentation.
- The system is designed to be maintainable, extensible, and user-friendly for all roles.
