# AutoFire Project Status

## Current Status
✅ **Database Functionality Restored**
✅ **NFPA Block Integration Complete**

The AutoFire system now has a fully functional database with:
- 170 manufacturers
- 118 system categories
- 14,704 devices imported from FireCad database export
- 630 fire alarm device specifications
- 6,468 devices registered with NFPA-compliant CAD blocks

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Fix
- **Issue**: Missing `system_categories` table in [db/loader.py](file://c:\Dev\Autofire\db\loader.py)
- **Solution**: Added the missing table definition to the [ensure_schema](file://c:\Dev\Autofire\db\loader.py#L13-L60) function
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### 2. Excel Import Functionality
- **Issue**: Need to import FireCad database exports
- **Solution**: Modified and tested [simple_excel_import.py](file://c:\Dev\Autofire\simple_excel_import.py) to work with FireCad exports
- **Result**: Successfully imported 14,704 devices from "Database Export.xlsx"
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### 3. NFPA Block Integration
- **Issue**: Need NFPA-compliant fire alarm block diagrams
- **Solution**: Implemented complete NFPA block registration system
- **Result**: 6,468 fire alarm devices registered with NFPA-compliant CAD blocks
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## Available Resources

### Database
The system now has a comprehensive device catalog from various manufacturers including:
- Edwards
- Autocall
- Ampac
- Siemens
- Honeywell
- Kidde
- System Sensor
- And many others

### CAD Blocks
User has uploaded DWG blocks from FireCad in the [Blocks](file://c:\Dev\Autofire\Blocks) directory:
- [20230328 CADGEN MISC BLOCKS 23-03-28T12-17-39 - Copy.dwg](file://c:\Dev\Autofire\Blocks\20230328%20CADGEN%20MISC%20BLOCKS%2023-03-28T12-17-39%20-%20Copy.dwg)

**Note**: These are DWG files which require specialized libraries or conversion to work with Python directly.

## Next Steps

### 1. GUI Improvements (High Priority)
Based on user feedback, comprehensive GUI improvements are needed:
- Device menu revamp for better readability
- Enhanced device properties window
- Improved menu organization and tool grouping
- Paper space viewport functionality
- Enhanced settings menu with more customization options
- See [TODO_GUI_IMPROVEMENTS.md](file://c:\Dev\Autofire\TODO_GUI_IMPROVEMENTS.md) for complete list

### 2. CAD Block Integration (High Priority)
Options for integrating DWG blocks:
- Convert DWG to DXF using external tools (AutoCAD, LibreCAD, etc.)
- Use specialized DWG libraries (commercial options like Teigha)
- Extract attribute data from DWG files to link with database

### 3. Project Information Management (Medium Priority)
Implement project metadata storage:
- Job numbers
- Client information
- Project addresses
- Designer information

### 4. Paperspace Text Block Implementation (Medium Priority)
Enhance title block functionality with custom text templates for consistent design output.

### 5. Underlay Scaling Implementation (Medium Priority)
Implement transformation matrix for scalable underlays (floor plans).

### 6. Complex Fire Alarm Calculations (Low Priority)
Add NFPA 72 compliant calculations:
- Voltage drop calculations
- Battery sizing
- Power consumption
- Wire gauge optimization
- Circuit utilization tracking

## Verification
The database has been verified to work correctly with queries by:
- Manufacturer
- Device category
- Device type

All core database functionality is restored and ready for use.
NFPA block integration has been verified with 6,468 devices successfully registered.
