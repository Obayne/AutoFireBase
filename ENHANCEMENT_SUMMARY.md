## Implementation Approach

Due to encoding issues with the main application file, enhancements were implemented in a modular approach:

1. Created `enhanced_menus.py` module with menu enhancement functions
2. Added additional methods to the main window class through dynamic method injection
3. Enhanced the settings dialog with additional tabs and options

## Benefits

1. **Complete Menu System**: All standard CAD application menus with comprehensive options
2. **Robust Settings**: Multi-tab settings dialog with all necessary configuration options
3. **Improved User Experience**: Better organization of features and tools
4. **Extensibility**: Modular design allows for easy future enhancements

## Future Improvements

1. Implement missing functionality for placeholder menu items
2. Add more comprehensive database management options
3. Enhance project management features
4. Add more advanced analysis tools

## Testing

The enhancements were designed to be non-intrusive and maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality.
