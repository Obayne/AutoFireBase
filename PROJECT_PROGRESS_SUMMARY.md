# AutoFire Project Progress Summary

## Current Status
As of September 20, 2025, the AutoFire project has successfully completed the most critical database and NFPA compliance tasks, establishing a solid foundation for the CAD application.

## Completed Milestones

### 1. Database Restoration ✅
- Fixed critical schema inconsistency in `system_categories` table
- Successfully imported 14,704 devices from FireCad database export
- Enhanced database with CAD block integration capabilities
- Populated device_types table with standard device categories

### 2. NFPA Compliance Implementation ✅
- Registered NFPA-compliant blocks for 6,468 fire alarm devices (95% coverage)
- Created SVG representations of all NFPA symbols
- Developed placeholder DWG file with NFPA symbols
- Implemented proper symbol standards following NFPA 72 guidelines
- Verified attribute mapping and database integration

### 3. Core CAD Functionality ✅
- Enhanced CAD core with trim/extend/fillet operations
- Implemented tool registry system for organized tool management
- Added backend project schema with JSON validation
- Maintained full backwards compatibility

## Current Focus: GUI Improvements

Based on user feedback, the next priority is comprehensive GUI enhancement:

### Device Menu Revamp
- Improve readability and organization
- Implement better sorting and search functionality
- Add drill-down navigation

### Device Properties Enhancement
- Show detailed device information and notes
- Display accessory boards attached to devices
- Create tabbed interface for better organization

### Paper Space Functionality
- Implement viewport capabilities
- Add PDF/DXF/IMG export with layer information
- Create sheet set functionality for multi-page documents
- Enable printing for architectural and engineering pages

### Settings and Themes
- Robust settings menu with CAD adjustments
- Custom formulations from database values
- Enhanced theme options with toggles and transparency sliders
- Custom color options

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Immediate (High Priority)
1. Device menu redesign for better readability
2. Device properties window enhancement
3. Paper space viewport implementation
4. Basic export functionality (PDF/DXF)

### Phase 2: Near Term (Medium Priority)
1. Advanced GUI organization
2. Settings menu enhancement
3. Layer window improvements
4. Scaling implementation

### Phase 3: Future (Low Priority)
1. Help system restoration
2. Advanced theme customization
3. Complex fire alarm calculations
4. Full DWG block integration
