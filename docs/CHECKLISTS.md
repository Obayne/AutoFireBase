Checklists — UI + Placement + Paperspace

UI Polish (Status/Command Bar)
- [ ] Command box width comfortable; bold label visible
- [ ] Autocomplete list shows expected aliases; Enter accepts selection
- [ ] F1 opens Command Reference; Ctrl+/ focuses command box
- [ ] Grid controls on right; status bar not crowded on 1366×768
- [ ] Accent color applies to highlights (default thin red)

Paperspace Annotations (Design Prep)
- [ ] Generic Paper palette defined (detector/strobe/speaker/pull/text)
- [ ] Paper layers naming agreed (AF_PAPER_*)
- [ ] Paper items do not write to catalog DB
- [ ] Mapping flow: multi‑select → assign real device(s) from catalog
- [ ] Post‑mapping: items carry catalog attributes; can generate schedules

Placement Stability
- [ ] “Place on click” only (no drop on move)
- [ ] Ghost preview follows cursor; ESC cancels cleanly
- [ ] Underlay scaling does not affect device Z‑order or snapping
- [ ] Snap indicators visible on dark backgrounds

Wiring & Calculations (Future)
- [ ] Represent multi‑cable runs on a single route
- [ ] Per‑segment gauge & length; voltage drop computed
- [ ] Reports: device schedule, wire totals by gauge, power

Workspace & Settings
- [ ] Dock/float/hide panels remembered between sessions
- [ ] Theme presets: Light, Dark+Red, High Contrast
- [ ] Accent color persists and is used across inputs/highlights
