```python
address = manager.add_device_to_circuit("SD355", circuit_id, x=100.0, y=100.0)
```

### 4. Connection Drawing
```python
connection_id = manager.create_device_connection(circuit1, addr1, circuit2, addr2)
```

### 5. Calculations and Validation
```python
calculations = manager.calculate_system_performance()
compliance = manager.validate_project_compliance()
```
