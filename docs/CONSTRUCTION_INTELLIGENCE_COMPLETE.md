```
# REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
Project: Corporate Office Building - Fire Alarm System

## Issues Identified:
1. Missing Detection (HIGH)
   - Storage Room requires fire detection
   - Suggested: Add smoke detector per NFPA 72

2. Mixed Manufacturers (MEDIUM)
   - Simplex and Edwards specs conflict
   - Suggested: Standardize on single manufacturer
```
