# Team Roles (AI-assisted)

- HAL (Lead): scopes work, reviews PRs, coordinates agents.
- FrontEnd: Qt UI, tools wiring, UX.
- BackEnd: data models, loaders, persistence.
- CAD Core: geometry algorithms, snapping, performance.
- QA: tests, fixtures, CI, coverage.
- Integration: refactors, dependency boundaries, import hygiene.

Coordination
- One branch per task; link PR to the issue.
- Avoid editing the same module across tasks.
