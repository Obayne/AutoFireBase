# AutoFire Project Manager Assessment Report
## Date: October 3, 2025
## Version: 0.8.0 (rescue/golden-path branch)

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The current AutoFire implementation has significant gaps compared to the full specification. While the UI foundation is solid, critical workflow components are missing or incomplete.

### SPEC vs IMPLEMENTATION GAP ANALYSIS

#### ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Partial)
1. **Basic UI Layout** - Model space window with toolbar/menus ✅
2. **Device Palette** - Basic device tree structure ✅
3. **Properties/Connections Tabs** - UI framework exists ✅
4. **CAD Drawing Tools** - Line/Rectangle/Circle/Polyline ✅
5. **Layer Management** - Basic layer structure ✅

#### ❌ MISSING CRITICAL COMPONENTS

##### 1. SPLASH SCREEN & PROJECT SETUP WORKFLOW
- **SPEC**: "Splash screen: version, recent projects, new/open buttons"
- **CURRENT**: Basic splash exists but workflow incomplete
- **GAP**: Missing project template system, DXF/PDF import

##### 2. SYSTEM BUILDER (Staging Warehouse)
- **SPEC**: "Panels tab: add FACP, boards, PSU, batteries. Devices tab: stage detectors..."
- **CURRENT**: SystemBuilderPanel exists but not integrated
- **GAP**: No staging workflow, no wire management, no "Assemble" function

##### 3. DEVICE PLACEMENT WORKFLOW
- **SPEC**: "Place panels first, then devices with coverage overlays"
- **CURRENT**: Basic device placement only
- **GAP**: No panel placement, no coverage overlays, no Array Fill tool

##### 4. WIRING & CONNECTIONS SYSTEM
- **SPEC**: "Pick wire spool, routing modes, segment tracking, live calculations"
- **CURRENT**: UI tabs exist but no backend
- **GAP**: No wire routing, no circuit management, no live calculations

##### 5. CALCULATION ENGINE
- **SPEC**: "Live calculations: VD, battery, SLC, conduit fill, coverage"
- **CURRENT**: Placeholder text only
- **GAP**: No calculation engine implemented

##### 6. AUTO-ADDRESSING SYSTEM
- **SPEC**: "When loops complete, addresses assigned per policy"
- **CURRENT**: Manual address input only
- **GAP**: No addressing automation

##### 7. REPORTS & OUTPUTS
- **SPEC**: "Riser diagrams, cable schedules, BOM, submittal packets"
- **CURRENT**: Menu stubs only
- **GAP**: No report generation system

##### 8. AI ASSISTANT
- **SPEC**: "Placement nudges, compliance QA, Ask AiHJ natural language"
- **CURRENT**: Empty tab
- **GAP**: No AI integration

##### 9. COMPLIANCE CHECKING
- **SPEC**: "NFPA/ADA rule checks, pass/warn/fail table"
- **CURRENT**: Menu stub only
- **GAP**: No compliance engine

##### 10. PROJECT MANAGEMENT SUITE
- **SPEC**: "Standalone suite with tasks, RFIs, emails, integrations"
- **CURRENT**: Not implemented
- **GAP**: Entire PM suite missing

### RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE FIXES (Phase 1)

#### Priority 1: Core Workflow Foundation
1. Fix splash screen → project setup → system builder workflow
2. Implement basic System Builder staging functionality
3. Connect device palette to staging system
4. Add panel placement workflow
5. Implement basic wire routing with visual feedback

#### Priority 2: Calculation Foundation
6. Build calculation engine framework
7. Add voltage drop calculator
8. Implement basic battery calculation
9. Add wire length tracking

#### Priority 3: Data Management
10. Implement project save/load with proper data model
11. Add device addressing system
12. Build basic BOM generation

### TECHNICAL DEBT CONCERNS
- Old app/ directory structure conflicts with new frontend/
- Multiple entry points (app/boot.py vs frontend/app.py)
- Incomplete migration from legacy codebase
- Missing integration between UI and calculation engines

### NEXT STEPS
1. Establish single entry point and remove app/ legacy code
2. Implement System Builder workflow as top priority
3. Build calculation engine foundation
4. Create proper data model for projects
5. Integrate workflow components step by step

### TIMELINE ESTIMATE
- Phase 1 (Core Workflow): 2-3 weeks
- Phase 2 (Calculations): 2-3 weeks
- Phase 3 (Reports/Compliance): 3-4 weeks
- Full specification compliance: 8-10 weeks

### RISK ASSESSMENT
- HIGH: Core workflow missing blocks user adoption
- MEDIUM: Calculation accuracy critical for professional use
- LOW: Advanced features (AI, PM Suite) can be phased later
