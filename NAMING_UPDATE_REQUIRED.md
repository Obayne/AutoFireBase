PROJECT NAMING & BRANDING UPDATE REQUIRED
==========================================

CRITICAL: Update all naming throughout the project

Current Naming Strategy:
- LVCAD: Layer Vision CAD Intelligence Engine (main project)
- AiHJ: AI Authority Having Jurisdiction (spin-off tool)
  └── Clever play on "AHJ" (Authority Having Jurisdiction)
  └── Positions as AI-powered regulatory intelligence

Files Requiring Name Updates:
1. fire_pilot.py → Rename to aihj.py
2. autofire_layer_intelligence.py → Update to LVCAD branding
3. All class names, comments, and documentation
4. Report headers and output text
5. Function names and variables
6. README and documentation files

AiHJ Positioning (Authority Having Jurisdiction + AI):
- Document compliance analysis
- Code interpretation and guidance
- Building systems regulatory review
- AI-powered AHJ intelligence

LVCAD Positioning (Layer Vision CAD):
- CAD layer intelligence engine
- Precise device detection and counting
- Engineering-grade accuracy
- Professional CAD analysis

TODO: Complete rebranding pass through entire codebase
