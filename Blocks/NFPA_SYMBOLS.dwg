This is a placeholder DWG file that would contain NFPA-compliant fire alarm symbols.
In a real implementation, this would be created with AutoCAD or similar CAD software.

The file would contain blocks for:
1. Smoke Detector (Diamond with diagonal line)
2. Heat Detector (Diamond shape)
3. Manual Pull Station (Rectangle)
4. Strobe (Circle)
5. Horn/Strobe (Circle with combined notation)
6. Speaker (Circle with sound notation)
7. Fire Alarm Control Panel (Large rectangle with connection points)

Each block would be properly attributed and named according to NFPA standards.
