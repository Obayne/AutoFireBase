# AutoFireBase

Overview
- Python app with CAD-style drawing tools and packaging via PyInstaller.
- This repo now includes standard Python hygiene: .gitignore, formatting, linting, and pre-commit hooks.

Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 (recommended), Git, PowerShell on Windows.

Quick Start (Windows, PowerShell)
- Clone and open this repo.
- Run: `./setup_dev.ps1` (creates `.venv`, installs requirements, sets up pre-commit).
- Activate later: `. .venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1`
- Run the app: `python app/main.py`
  - Alternative (new entry): `python -m frontend.app`
- Use the CLI: `autofire-cli device --help` (after `pip install -e .`)

Daily Workflow
- Activate venv: `. .venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1`
- Sync: `git pull` (ensure youâ€™re on the correct branch).
- Code changes.
- Format/lint: `ruff check --fix .` and `black .` (pre-commit will also run these on commit).
- Commit: `git add -A && git commit -m "..."`
- Push: `git push` and open a PR.

CLI Tools
- After installing with `pip install -e .`, use `autofire-cli` for device management:
  - `autofire-cli device list` - List devices
  - `autofire-cli device search <query>` - Search devices
  - `autofire-cli device add --name "Device" --type "Type"` - Add devices
  - `autofire-cli device stats` - Show catalog statistics
  - `autofire-cli device --help` - Full command reference

Code Style & Tooling
- Black (line length 100) for formatting.
- Ruff for lint + import sorting; targets Python 3.11.
- Pre-commit runs Ruff + Black + basic whitespace fixes on commit.

Build
- Use the existing scripts: `Build_AutoFire.ps1` or `Build_AutoFire_Debug.ps1`.
- PyInstaller spec files (`AutoFire.spec`, `AutoFire_Debug.spec`) are kept in repo; build artifacts are ignored (`build/`, `dist/`).

Repo Hygiene
- Do not commit virtual envs, caches, `build/`, `dist/`, or backup files. Patterns are covered in `.gitignore`.
- Samples: the `Projects/` folder currently contains example assets (DXF/PDF/.autofire). Keep or move into a dedicated `samples/` folder in future if desired.

Contributing
- Branch from `main` using feature branches: `feat/<topic>` or `fix/<topic>`.
- Create small, focused PRs. The CI/tooling will enforce formatting and linting locally via pre-commit.

Database
- Storage: SQLite catalog at `~\AutoFire\catalog.db` (created on first use).
- Tasks: init/seed/backup/restore, list/search/show/count, and export/import via `scripts\device_cli.py`.
- Details: see `docs/DATABASE.md` for schema and CLI examples.
