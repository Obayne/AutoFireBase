# SVG Panel Symbols

These SVGs are used for main fire alarm system blocks in the UI and system builder:

- `facp.svg`: Fire Alarm Control Panel (rectangle, label FACP)
- `fcps.svg`: Fire Alarm Power Supply (rectangle, label FCPS)
- `amp.svg`: Amplifier (rectangle, label AMP)
- `jct.svg`: Junction Box (rectangle, label JCT)

To use: map device type/model to the correct SVG in the device palette, system builder, and placement logic.

Add more SVGs as needed for additional panel/board types.
