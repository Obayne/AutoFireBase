# Block Integration Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement
- Added `cad_blocks` table to store block information
- Created foreign key relationship with devices table
- Added functions for block registration and retrieval

### 2. Block Registration System
- Implemented `register_block_for_device()` function
- Implemented `get_block_for_device()` function
- Implemented `fetch_devices_with_blocks()` function

### 3. Block Linking Demonstration
- Successfully linked devices to CAD blocks
- Created attribute mapping between database fields and block properties
- Verified block registration and retrieval

## üìä Current Capabilities

### Database Structure
The system now has a complete block integration schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cad_blocks(
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    device_id INTEGER,
    block_name TEXT,
    block_path TEXT,
    block_attributes TEXT, -- JSON format for attribute mapping
    FOREIGN KEY(device_id) REFERENCES devices(id)
);
```

### Functions Available
1. `register_block_for_device()` - Link a CAD block to a device
2. `get_block_for_device()` - Retrieve block information for a device
3. `fetch_devices_with_blocks()` - Get all devices with their block information

### Block Information Structure
Each block registration includes:
- **block_name**: Identifier for the block
- **block_path**: Path to the DWG file
- **block_attributes**: JSON mapping of device properties to block attributes

Example:
```json
{
  "PartNo": "C2M-PD1",
  "Manufacturer": "Edwards",
  "Type": "Smoke Detector",
  "Category": "Smoke Detector",
  "Description": "Smoke Detector - 2 Wire Photo electric"
}
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Batch Block Registration
- Create utility to register multiple blocks at once
- Implement block library management
- Add block search and filtering capabilities

### 2. Attribute Mapping Enhancement
- Develop more sophisticated attribute mapping
- Add support for dynamic attribute population
- Implement attribute validation

### 3. Integration with CAD Interface
- Link block selection to device catalog
- Implement block placement with attribute population
- Add block library browser

## üìÅ Current Block Files
The system currently works with the following DWG files:
- [20230328 CADGEN MISC BLOCKS 23-03-28T12-17-39 - Copy.dwg](file://c:\Dev\Autofire\Blocks\20230328%20CADGEN%20MISC%20BLOCKS%2023-03-28T12-17-39%20-%20Copy.dwg)
- [20230328 CADGEN MISC BLOCKS 23-03-28T12-17-39.dwg](file://c:\Dev\Autofire\Blocks\20230328%20CADGEN%20MISC%20BLOCKS%2023-03-28T12-17-39.dwg)
- [20230328 RISER BLOCKS 23-03-28T11-30-52.dwg](file://c:\Dev\Autofire\Blocks\20230328%20RISER%20BLOCKS%2023-03-28T11-30-52.dwg)
- [DEVICE DETAILBLOCKS 23-03-28T12-52-01.dwg](file://c:\Dev\Autofire\Blocks\DEVICE%20DETAILBLOCKS%2023-03-28T12-52-01.dwg)
- [ERRCS 23-04-01T03-09-07 - Copy.dwg](file://c:\Dev\Autofire\Blocks\ERRCS%2023-04-01T03-09-07%20-%20Copy.dwg)
- [ERRCS 23-04-01T03-09-07.dwg](file://c:\Dev\Autofire\Blocks\ERRCS%2023-04-01T03-09-07.dwg)

## üéØ Future Considerations

### DWG to DXF Conversion
For full block integration, consider:
1. **LibreCAD** - Free, open-source CAD application with batch conversion
2. **Teigha** - Commercial libraries for DWG/DXF processing
3. **AutoCAD** - Professional solution with scripting capabilities

### Block Attribute Extraction
Future work could include:
1. Direct attribute reading from DWG files
2. Automatic block-to-device matching
3. Block preview and validation

## ‚úÖ Verification
The block integration has been verified with:
- Database schema creation
- Block registration and retrieval
- Attribute mapping
- Device linking

The system is ready for further development and integration with the CAD interface.
