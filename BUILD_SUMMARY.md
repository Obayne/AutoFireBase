## Build Process Overview

The AutoFire application was successfully built for both release and debug configurations using PyInstaller.

## Release Build

- **Executable**: `dist\AutoFire\AutoFire.exe`
- **Size**: 8,412,108 bytes
- **Build Time**: September 18, 2025, 4:59 AM
- **Configuration**: Windowed application (no console)

## Debug Build

- **Executable**: `dist\AutoFire_Debug\AutoFire_Debug.exe`
- **Size**: 8,419,744 bytes
- **Build Time**: September 18, 2025, 5:00 AM
- **Configuration**: Console application (shows output)

## Build Steps Completed

1. Verified all required dependencies were installed:
   - PySide6 (6.9.2)
   - ezdxf (1.4.2)
   - reportlab (4.4.3)
   - jsonschema (4.25.1)
   - pyinstaller (6.15.0)
   - shapely (2.3.2)
   - black (25.1.0)
   - ruff (0.13.0)

2. Ran code quality checks (ruff reported issues but build proceeded)

3. Tested that the application imports correctly from source

4. Cleaned previous build artifacts

5. Built release version using AutoFire.spec configuration

6. Verified release executable was created successfully

7. Built debug version with console output enabled

8. Verified debug executable was created successfully

## Executable Features

Both executables include:
- All necessary Python libraries
- Qt dependencies (PySide6)
- CAD libraries (ezdxf, shapely)
- PDF generation capabilities (reportlab)
- SQLite database support
- All application modules and resources

## Running the Application

### Release Version
```
dist\AutoFire\AutoFire.exe
```

### Debug Version
```
dist\AutoFire_Debug\AutoFire_Debug.exe
```

The debug version will show console output which is helpful for troubleshooting.

## Next Steps

1. Test both executables to ensure they function correctly
2. Distribute the release version to end users
3. Use the debug version for development and troubleshooting
4. Consider creating an installer package for easier distribution

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues running the executables:

1. Ensure all required system libraries are available
2. Check Windows Event Viewer for any error messages
3. Run the debug version to see console output
4. Verify that Windows Defender or other antivirus software is not blocking the executable
