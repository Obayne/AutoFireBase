# Comprehensive Guide to Fire Alarm System Submittals

## Overview

Fire alarm system submittals are the collection of documents and drawings submitted to the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) - typically the local fire department, building official, or fire marshal - for review and approval prior to system installation. These submittals demonstrate that the proposed fire alarm system meets all applicable codes, standards, and local requirements.

## 1. What Are Fire Alarm System Submittals?

Fire alarm system submittals are formal documentation packages that provide complete technical details about the proposed fire alarm system. They serve multiple purposes:

- **Code Compliance Verification**: Demonstrate adherence to NFPA 72, International Fire Code (IFC), and local codes
- **System Approval**: Obtain AHJ permission to install the system
- **Installation Guidance**: Provide contractors with detailed installation instructions
- **Record Keeping**: Create permanent documentation for the building owner and future maintenance

Submittals are typically required at two stages:

- **Preliminary Submittals**: Basic system design for initial approval
- **Final Submittals**: Complete detailed documentation for final approval
