## Detailed Issues

### 1. NFPA Spacing Violation (HIGH)
**Description:** Smoke detector at (60, 10) may exceed 30-foot spacing requirement
**Reference:** FA-101
**Suggested Resolution:** Verify spacing meets NFPA 72 Section 17.7.3.2.3.1

### 2. Mixed Manufacturers (MEDIUM)
**Description:** Multiple manufacturers specified: simplex, edwards
**Reference:** Specifications
**Suggested Resolution:** Clarify if mixed manufacturer system is acceptable or standardize on single manufacturer

### 3. NFPA 72 Mass Notification (MEDIUM)
**Description:** Assembly occupancy may require mass notification system
**Reference:** FA-101
**Suggested Resolution:** Verify mass notification requirements per NFPA 72 Chapter 24

### 4. IBC Egress Notification (HIGH)
**Description:** Corridors require notification appliances per IBC egress requirements
**Reference:** A-101
**Suggested Resolution:** Add notification appliances in egress corridors per IBC Section 1006

### 5. ADA Pull Station Height (MEDIUM)
**Description:** Verify pull station mounting heights comply with ADA (15" min, 48" max to operable part)
**Reference:** FA-101
**Suggested Resolution:** Confirm pull station heights meet ADA Section 205 reach range requirements

### 6. ADA Accessible Route Notification (MEDIUM)
**Description:** Verify notification appliances provide adequate coverage along accessible routes
**Reference:** A-101
**Suggested Resolution:** Ensure 75 cd minimum in corridors and accessible routes per ADA

### 7. IMC Duct Detector Requirements (HIGH)
**Description:** Mechanical rooms present but no duct detectors specified
**Reference:** A-101
**Suggested Resolution:** Verify duct detector requirements per IMC Section 606.2 and coordinate installation trade

### 8. IMC Computer Room Protection (MEDIUM)
**Description:** Computer/data rooms may require special fire protection systems
**Reference:** A-101
**Suggested Resolution:** Verify IMC requirements for computer rooms and coordinate with mechanical systems

### 9. Trade Coordination - Duct Detectors (CRITICAL)
**Description:** CRITICAL: Duct detector installation responsibility unclear - Mechanical or Fire Alarm contractor?
**Reference:** General
**Location:** HVAC systems
**Suggested Resolution:** Clarify duct detector installation responsibility:
- Option 1: Mechanical contractor installs, FA contractor wires/programs
- Option 2: FA contractor furnishes and installs complete
- Coordinate access, mounting, and wiring requirements
- Specify shutdown relay locations and responsibilities

### 10. Electrical Coordination - Power (MEDIUM)
**Description:** Fire alarm panel power supply coordination required with electrical contractor
**Reference:** General
**Suggested Resolution:** Coordinate dedicated 20A circuit, surge protection, and emergency power requirements

### 11. Mechanical Coordination - HVAC Shutdown (HIGH)
**Description:** HVAC system shutdown coordination required for fire alarm activation
**Reference:** A-101
**Suggested Resolution:** Coordinate HVAC shutdown relays, fan control, and damper operation with mechanical contractor

### 12. General Coordination - Ceiling Access (MEDIUM)
**Description:** Fire alarm device installation requires ceiling coordination
**Reference:** General
**Suggested Resolution:** Coordinate ceiling grid modifications, access panels, and patching requirements

### 13. Trade Coordination - Duct Detectors (CRITICAL)
**Description:** CRITICAL: Duct detector installation responsibility unclear - Mechanical or Fire Alarm contractor?
**Reference:** General
**Location:** HVAC systems
**Suggested Resolution:** Clarify duct detector installation responsibility:
- Option 1: Mechanical contractor installs, FA contractor wires/programs
- Option 2: FA contractor furnishes and installs complete
- Coordinate access, mounting, and wiring requirements
- Specify shutdown relay locations and responsibilities

### 14. Electrical Coordination - Power (MEDIUM)
**Description:** Fire alarm panel power supply coordination required with electrical contractor
**Reference:** General
**Suggested Resolution:** Coordinate dedicated 20A circuit, surge protection, and emergency power requirements

### 15. Mechanical Coordination - HVAC Shutdown (HIGH)
**Description:** HVAC system shutdown coordination required for fire alarm activation
**Reference:** A-101
**Suggested Resolution:** Coordinate HVAC shutdown relays, fan control, and damper operation with mechanical contractor

### 16. General Coordination - Ceiling Access (MEDIUM)
**Description:** Fire alarm device installation requires ceiling coordination
**Reference:** General
**Suggested Resolution:** Coordinate ceiling grid modifications, access panels, and patching requirements

## Recommendations
- Address 2 critical issues before proceeding with construction
- Verify all designs meet current NFPA 72 requirements
- Consider design review meeting to address multiple issues
